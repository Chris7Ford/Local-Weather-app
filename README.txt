# Local Weather Web Application

### Getting Started

To use the weather app, clone the repository and open the index.html file in your favorite browser.  You must allow the app to use your current location.

### Built with
This project was part of the Free Code Camp Cirriculum, and was one of my first projects made with HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.  This project uses the user's current location and the open weather API to show the local weather.
